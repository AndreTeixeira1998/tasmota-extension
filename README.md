Tasmota Extensions
==================

Some Tasmota firmware extensions used with OpenHab.

**tasmota-discover** is a simple bash script to list all tasmota devices available on the same LAN as the computer.

**tasmota-flash** is a simple bash script to erase and/or flash ESP8266 and ESP32 decices.

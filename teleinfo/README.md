Teleinfo Tasmota firmware for Linky meters
=============

Presentation
------------

This evolution of Tasmota firmware has been enhanced to handle France energy meters known as **Linky** using **Teleinfo** protocol.

This implementation has been tested on :
  * Sagem classic meter **monophase** with TIC **historique**
  * Linky meter **monophase** with TIC **historique**
  * Linky meter **monophase** with TIC **standard**
  * Linky meter **triphase** with TIC **historique**
  * Linky meter **triphase** with TIC **standard**
  * Ace6000 meter **triphase** with TIC **PME/PMI**

It is compatible with **ESP8266** and **ESP32** chipsets.
 
Please note that it is a completly different implementation than the one published early 2020 by Charles Hallard. 

Some of these firmware versions are using a LittleFS partition to store graph data. Il allows to keep historical data over reboots.
To take advantage of this feature, make sure to follow partitioning procedure given in the **readme** of the **binary** folder.

This firmware calculates Power Factor (Cos Ï†) from Teleinfo totals (W) and Instant Power (VA). It is calculated everytime total power increases.

This firmware provides some extra Web page on the device :
  * **/tic-graph** : live, daily and weekly graphs (VA, W, V and Cos phi)
  * **/tic-msg** : real time display of last received Teleinfo message

It also provides :
  * a TCP server to stream teleinfo
  * a FTP server to easily retrieve logs

If you are using a LittleFS version, you'll also get peak apparent power and peak voltage on the graphs.

If your linky in in historic mode, it doesn't provide instant voltage. Voltage is then forced to 230V.

Pre-compiled versions are available in the [**binary**](https://github.com/NicolasBernaerts/tasmota/tree/master/teleinfo/binary) folder.

Teleinfo protocol is described in [this document](https://www.enedis.fr/sites/default/files/Enedis-NOI-CPT_54E.pdf)

MQTT data
---------

In the configuration page, you can ecide to publish Teleinfo data in a specific MQTT **TIC** section.

You'll then retrieve all teleinfo keys :
  * **ADCO**, **ADCS** = contract number
  * **ISOUSC** = max contract current per phase 
  * **SSOUSC** = max contract power per phase
  * **IINST**, **IINST1**, **IINST2**, **IINST3** = instant current per phase
  * **ADIR1**, **ADIR2**, **ADIR3** = overload message
  * ...

You can also retrieve all energy meter values under MQTT **METER** :
  * **PH** = number of phases
  * **PSUB** = power per phase in the contract (VA) 
  * **ISUB** = current per phase in the contract 
  * **PMAX** = maximum power per phase including an accetable % of overload (VA)  
  * **Ix** = instant current on phase **x** 
  * **Ux** = instant voltage on phase **x** 
  * **Px** = instant apparent power on phase **x** 
  * **Wx** = instant active power on phase **x** 
  * **Cx** = instant power factor on phase **x** 

MQTT result should look like that :

TCP server
----------

To retrieve the complete teleinfo stream over your LAN, you just need to start the embedded TCP server thru tasmota console :

    # tcp_start 8888
        11:39:49.836 CMD: tcp_start 8888
        11:39:49.840 TCP: Starting TCP server on port 8888
        11:39:49.844 MQT: turenne/compteur/stat/RESULT = {"tcp_start":"Done"}

You can now receive your Linky teleinfo stream in real time on any Linux pc :

    # nc 192.168.1.10 8888
        SMAXSN-1	E220422144756	05210	W
        CCASN	E220423110000	01468	:
        CCASN-1	E220423100000	01444	Q
        UMOY1	E220423114000	235	(
        STGE	003A0001	:
        MSG1	PAS DE          MESSAGE         	<

To stop streaming, you just need to stop the embedded TCP server thru tasmota console :

    # tcp_stop
        11:59:49.836 CMD: tcp_stop
        11:59:49.840 TCP: Stoping TCP server
        11:59:49.844 MQT: turenne/compteur/stat/RESULT = {"tcp_stop":"Done"}

FTP server
----------

If you are using a build with a LittleFS partition, this firmware runs a simple FTP server.

Il allows you to connect automatically to retrieve daily and weekly energy logs. It is automatically started. 

Credentials are :
  * login : **teleinfo**
  * password : **teleinfo**

This embedded FTP server main limitation is that it can only one connexion at a time. \
So you need to limit simultaneous connexions to **1** on your FTP client. Otherwise, connexion will fail.

Compilation
-----------

If you want to compile this firmware version, you just need to :
1. install official tasmota sources
2. place or replace files from this repository
3. place specific files from **tasmota/common** repository
4. install **FTPClientServer** library

Here are the files needed from the **tasmota/common** repository :
* xdrv_50_filesystem_cfg_csv.ino
* xdrv_93_esp32_board.ino
* xdrv_94_ip_address.ino
* xdrv_95_timezone.ino
* xdrv_96_ftp_server.ino
* xdrv_97_tcp_server.ino

You also need to place all files from **tasmota/common/FTPClientServer** under **lib/default/FTPClientServer**.

If everything goes fine, you should be able to compile your own build.

Adapter
-------

Between your Energy meter and your Tasmota device, you'll need an adapter to convert **Teleinfo** signal to **TTL serial**.

A very simple adapter diagram can be this one. Pleasee note that some Linky meters may need a resistor as low as **1k** instead of **1.5k** to avoid transmission errors.

![Simple Teleinfo adapter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasBernaerts/tasmota/master/teleinfo/screen/teleinfo-adapter-simple-diagram.png)

Here is a board example using a monolithic 3.3V power supply and an ESP-01.

![Simple Teleinfo board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasBernaerts/tasmota/master/teleinfo/screen/teleinfo-adapter-simple-board.png)

You need to connect your adapter output **ESP Rx** to any available serial port of your Tasmota device.

This port should be connected to your ESP UART and be declared as **TInfo RX**.

For example, you can use :
  * ESP8266 : **GPIO3 (RXD)** port
  * WT32-ETH01 : **GPIO5 (RXD)** port
  * Olimex ESP32-POE : **GPIO2** port

Finaly, in **Configure Teleinfo** you need to select your Teleinfo adapter baud rate :
  * **1200** (original white meter or green Linky in historic mode)
  * **9600** (green Linky in standard mode)

If you are using an **ESP32** device, you can use its **Ethernet** port after selecting the proper board on the **Configure ESP32** menu.
